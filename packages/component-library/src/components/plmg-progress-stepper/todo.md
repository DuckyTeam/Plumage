# Stepper Component To do
- [ ] Check with design that we can expose stepper item component as a seperate component
- [ ] Complete step item
- [ ] Complete stepper
- [ ] Generate stepper control component
- [ ] Check accessibility

## Suggestion
- [ ] We call step item component 'step'
- [ ] We called the control component 'progress-stepper'

## Step Component (the dumb one)
- No internal logic - 'dumb' use permitted
- Click event emitted - used by the control component

## Stepper Component (the smart one)
- Controls the step process
- Generates an array of steps
- Each step
- Step control
    - 
- Control stepper state
- Each item
-
